# MIPS
This repository contains all of the modules needed for our 32-bit MIPS ISA Processor top-level design blocks, instruction and data modules to verify our design. This processor was designed on a Nexys 4 FPGA board by Digilent, programmed in XILINX ISE.

MS_32.docx contains further information in our design.
