# MIPS
This repository contains all of the modules needed for our 32-bit MIPS ISA Processor, included will be simulation logs for design verification, top-level design blocks, instruction and data modules to load into our design. This processor was designed on a Nexys 4 FPGA board by Digilent, programmed in XILINX ISE.
